* This Summary is not a license. It is simply a convenient reference for understanding the full CL DUO SDK License Agreement. The Summary is written as a user-friendly interface to the full CL DUO SDK License below. This Summary itself has no legal value, and its contents do not appear in the actual license.

Full License Agreement:

1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement (the "License"), CL, Inc. ("CL") hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, sublicenseable copyright license to use, reproduce, redistribute (subject to restrictions below), modify, and improve the software contained in this CL DUO Software Development Kit ("DUO SDK"), including, but not limited to, applications, drivers, firmware, samples, headers and source.  

This license is subject to the following terms and conditions:

1.1. This license includes the non-exclusive license and right to use (i) the DUO SDK to make applications, content, systems and demos (collectively and generally referred to as “Developer Content”) that run on the CL approved mobile hardware and software products (“CL Approved DUO Products”) and which may incorporate the DUO SDK in whole or in part in binary or object code; and (ii) to use the DUO SDK to create derivative works of the DUO SDK itself ("DUO SDK Derivatives"), whether in source, binary, or object form, in whole or in part, including third party software unless otherwise noted.

1.2. DUO SDK Derivatives are further defined as source, binary or object code derived exclusively from the DUO SDK by you; provided, however, that DUO SDK Derivatives do not include the Developer Content (engines, utilities, applications, content, systems or demos) which may be developed using the DUO SDK. By way of example a mobile application or system or demo that is developed using the DUO SDK would not be a DUO SDK Derivative , nor would a utility or tool set in a pre-existing system engine that is adapted to work with the DUO SDK be a DUO SDK Derivative. By way of example, but not limitation, a DUO SDK Derivative is or would be: either (i) an adaptation of a utility or piece of code from the DUO SDK to improve efficiency; or (ii) an addition of code or improvement to the DUO SDK that adds functionality.

1.3 For the sake of clarification when you use the DUO SDK (including DUO SDK Derivatives) in or with Developer Content, you retain all rights to your Developer Content, and you have no obligations to share or license Developer Content (including your source and object code) to CL or any third parties; provided, however, CL retains all rights to the DUO SDK and the DUO SDK Derivatives that may be incorporated into your Developer Content.

2. You, the recipient and user of the DUO SDK, hereby agree and accept that that CL shall own all right, title and interest to the intellectual property rights, including, but limited to copyright, trademark and patent rights, to any DUO SDK Derivatives that you may create, and you hereby assign any and all such rights to such DUO SDK Derivatives to CL, subject to the following.

2.1 We hereby grant to you the a fully paid up, no-charge, royalty-free, world-wide, in perpetuity, non-exclusive right and license back to use these DUO SDK Derivatives solely in conjunction with the DUO SDK (or any components of the DUO SDK) and/or Developer Content on CL DUO Products as set forth herein.

2.2 Furthermore, for the sake of clarification, CL and its assignees and licensees shall be free to use such DUO SDK Derivatives without any approval from you and without compensation or attribution to you.

2.3 You also agree upon CL's request to provide the source and binary code of any DUO SDK Derivatives to CL. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS REQUEST IS THE BASIS FOR AUTOMATIC TERMINATION OF THIS LICENSE BY CL.

3. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, your license to redistribute and sublicense the DUO SDK and DUO SDK Derivatives is also expressly made subject to the following conditions:

3.1. You may sublicense and redistribute the source, binary, or object code of the DUO SDK in whole or in part by itself for no charge or as part of a for charge piece of Developer Content; provided, however, you may only license, sublicense or redistribute the source, binary or object code of DUOLib in whole, and you may not license, sublicense or redistribute any portion or element of DUOLib separately or in part (in either source, binary or object form). If you license, sublicense or redistribute DUO SDK Derivatives in and of themselves (not as a part of a piece of Developer Content) then you may only do that solely with and in conjunction with either the DUO SDK or DUOLib. The DUO SDK (including, but not limited to DUOLib), any DUO SDK Derivatives, and any Developer Content may only be used with CL Approved DUO Products and may not be used, licensed, or sublicensed to interface with mobile software or hardware or other commercial headsets, mobile tablets or phones that are not authorized and approved by CL;

3.2. You must include with all such redistributed or sublicensed DUO SDK or DUO SDK Derivatives code the following copyright notice: "Copyright © 2014 CL, Inc. All rights reserved," and include the list of conditions contained in this Section 3, including the full text of the disclaimer in Section 3.6 below;

3.3. Neither the name of CL, Inc. nor the names of CL, Inc.'s contributors, licensors, employees, or contractors, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this DUO SDK without specific prior written permission of CL, Inc.;

3.4. You must give any other recipients of the DUO SDK or any elements thereof, including DUOLib or DUO SDK Derivatives, a copy of this License as such recipients, licensees or sublicensees may only use the DUO SDK or any DUO SDK Derivatives or any elements thereof subject to the terms of this Licence and such recipients, licensees or sublicensees agreement and acceptance of this License with CL (which will convey all rights to the recipients’ or licensees’ or sublicensees’ DUO SDK Derivatives to CL), and you must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files;

3.5. If the DUO SDK or a specific element thereof such as DUOLib includes a "LICENSE" text file as part of its distribution (the “License Notice”), then any DUO SDK Derivatives that you distribute with the DUO SDK in whole or in part must include a readable copy of such attribution notices as are contained within the applicable License Notice file (excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the DUO SDK Derivatives), in at least one of the following places: within a License Notice text file distributed as part of the DUO SDK Derivatives; within the source form or documentation, if provided along with the DUO SDK Derivatives; or, within a display generated by the DUO SDK Derivatives, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. You must also include in the License Notice file for all DUO SDK Derivatives a copy of all notices (including any product liability or health and safety notices). The contents of the License Notice file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add your own attribution notices within DUO SDK Derivatives that you distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the License Notice text from the DUO SDK or any part thereof, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

3.6. THIS DUO SDK AND ANY COMPONENT THEREOF IS PROVIDED BY CL AND ITS CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL CL AS THE COPYRIGHT OWNER OR ITS CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS DUO SDK OR THE DUO SDK DERIVATIVES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

4. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of CL, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the DUO SDK, DUOLib, or any element thereof, and reproducing the content of the License Notice file.

5. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall CL or any contributor be liable to you or your licensees or sublicensees for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the DUO SDK, DUOLib, any element thereof or any DUO SDK Derivatives (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if you or such contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

6. Your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this License in and of itself and for all Developer Content created as of April 1, 2014, may be evidenced by any of the following: your usage of the DUO SDK or any element thereof, acceptance of the click-through agreement, or opening the packaging of the CD-ROM containing the DUO SDK or any element thereof, including DUOLib. As this License is updated for future releases of the DUO SDK and/or DUOLib, you agree to abide by and meet all requirements of future updates of this License for those future DUO SDK releases as evidenced by the same usage of the DUO SDK or any element thereof and the future updates of this License will apply for that future Developer Content that may developed for or with that future DUO SDK or any element thereof (i.e., you cannot sidestep out of the requirements of future updates of the License by developing against an older release of the DUO SDK or License).

7. CL reserves the right to terminate this License and all your rights hereunder in the event you materially breach this License and fail to cure such breach within ten (10) business days after notice of breach from CL.

8. Furthermore, CL also reserves the right to cancel or terminate this License for any of the following reasons upon notice to you, subject to the appeal process set forth in Section 14 for a wrongful termination:

a.	Intellectual property infringement by you with Developer Content or DUO SDK Derivatives created by you that is used with or by the DUO SDK or any part thereof, or any of the DUO SDK Derivatives;
b.	Developer Content that violates or infringes upon applicable law;
c.	Health and safety issues associated with your Developer Content;
d.	Failure to comply with or use properly the CL Warnings, CL Protocols, or CL EULA;
e.	Use of the DUO SDK, DUO SDK Derivatives or DUOLib with a commercial product other than an CL Approved Product; and
f.	Failure to provide required notices or deliver source code and/or binary of DUO SDK Derivatives as set forth above.

If you believe that you have been wrongfully terminated under this Section 8 with respect to material breach or with respect to these above conditions, you have the right to appeal the termination of this License under Section 14.

9. This License may be amended by CL on a prospective basis, and your usage of the License after such amendments or changes signifies your consent to and acceptance of any such amendments or changes on a going forward basis.

10. In the event any provision of this License is determined to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable by a court or other body of competent jurisdiction, this License shall be construed as if such invalid, prohibited or unenforceable provision has been more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable.

11. You may not assign any rights or obligations under this License without the advance written consent of CL, which may be withheld in its sole discretion. CL may assign its rights or obligations under this License in its sole discretion.

12. Failure of either party at any time to enforce any of the provisions of this License will not be construed as a waiver of such provisions or in any way affect the validity of this License or parts thereof.

13. Your remedies under this License shall be limited to the right to collect money damages, if any, and you hereby waive your right to injunctive or other equitable relief.

14. This License shall be governed by the laws of the State of Nevada, without giving effect to choice of law principles. All disputes relating to this License shall be resolved by binding non-appearance-based arbitration before a neutral arbitrator in Clark County, Nevada. If your License has been terminated hereunder by CL, you may appeal your termination through this arbitration process on an expedited basis with an arbitration within thirty days of your giving CL notice of the appeal. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules and procedures of JAMS then in effect, and the judgment of the arbitrator shall be final and capable of entry in any court of competent jurisdiction. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Clark County, Nevada in connection with any entrance of an arbitrator’s judgment or decision or any dispute with respect to the arbitration process or procedure or Code Laboratories’s exercise of its equitable rights or remedies.
